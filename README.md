# ML based number recognizer

## Numpy
In main.py I have implemented a neural network with 2 hidden layers using only numpy. After optimizing the hyperparameters I have reached over 95% accuracy on the testing data over 20 epoch of learning.

## PyTorch
In intorch.py I have implemented the same neural network, but using softmax and crossentropy loss. The model achieved over 97% accuracy over just 10 epochs.

## Window
In window.py I have made a window in pygame, through which the user can input their own hand-drawn numbers. You can choose which model to use for the predictions.
